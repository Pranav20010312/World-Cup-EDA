#  2022 T20 World Cup Exploratary Data Analysis
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on T20 World Cup 2022 data to gain insights and inform decision-making in the cricket tournament. The following steps were undertaken to analyze the data and derive valuable insights:

# **Data Collection and Preparation:**

•	T20 World Cup 2022 data was obtained from reliable sources such as official cricket websites or datasets available online.

•	Data cleaning was done using Excel before being imported into Jupyter.

# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

•	Python was used to conduct EDA on the T20 World Cup dataset, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

•	Visualizations, and data aggregation techniques were employed to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.

# **Key Insights:**
•	Based on the analysis, the following key insights were derived:

•	Performance analysis of teams based on wins  and match outcomes.

•	Player performance analysis, including highest run-scorers, wicket-takers, batting averages, and bowling averages.

•	Comparison of player performances across different teams.

•	Impact of batting or bowling first on match outcomes.


# **Technologies Used:**

•	Python: Used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
