#  2022 T20 World Cup Exploratary Data Analysis
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on T20 World Cup 2022 data to gain insights and inform decision-making in the cricket tournament. The following steps were undertaken to analyze the data and derive valuable insights:

# **Data Collection and Preparation:**

•	T20 World Cup 2022 data was obtained from reliable sources such as official cricket websites or datasets available online.

•	Data cleaning was done using Excel before being imported into Jupyter.

# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

•	Python was used to conduct EDA on the T20 World Cup dataset, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

•	Visualizations, and data aggregation techniques were employed to explore the data and identify trends and patterns.

# **Key Insights:**
•	Based on the analysis, the following key insights were derived:

•	Performance analysis of teams based on win percentages, total championships won, and match outcomes.

•	Player performance analysis, including highest run-scorers, wicket-takers, batting averages, and bowling averages.

•	Analysis of team strategies, such as preferred batting positions, run rates, dismissal patterns, and fielding strategies.

•	Relationship between team performance and home ground advantage.

•	Comparison of player performances across different teams.

•	Impact of batting or bowling first on match outcomes.

# **Recommendations:**

•	Based on the insights gained from the analysis, the following recommendations can be made to improve team strategies and enhance the T20 World Cup experience:

•	Formulate game strategies by considering the impact of batting or bowling first.

•	Focus on acquiring or selecting high-performing players based on their statistics.

•	Leverage data-driven insights to optimize batting line-ups, bowling strategies, and fielding positions.

•	Analyze performance trends and adapt team strategies accordingly.

•	Consider the balance between player performances and team dynamics when making key decisions.

# **Technologies Used:**

•	Python: Used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

•	Jupyter Notebook: Used as the development environment for Python scripting and analysis.

•	Data Visualization Libraries: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.
